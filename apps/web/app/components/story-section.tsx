        Their journey began, as many great love stories do, serendipitously on a night out in Washington, D.C. On the
        dance floor of Tropicalia, a basement bar and club, an undeniable gravity drew Hunter and Katy together. What
        started as a night in the District quickly blossomed into dinner dates, weekends spent at Katy's D.C. apartment,
        and the adventure of memorable firstsâ€”like Katy's first trip to Richmond and Hunter's to Florida. Step by step,
        their lives intertwined, from separate apartments to shared ones, then to a Richmond home and the adoption of
        their beloved dog, Buoy.
