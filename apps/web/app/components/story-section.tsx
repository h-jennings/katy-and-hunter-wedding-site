          Their journey began, as many great love stories do, serendipitously on a night out in Washington, D.C. On the
          dance floor of Tropicalia, a basement bar and club, an undeniable gravity drew Hunter and Katy together. What
          started as a night in the District quickly blossomed into dinner dates, weekends spent at Katy's D.C.
          apartment, and the adventure of memorable firstsâ€”like Katy's first trip to Richmond and Hunter's to Florida.
          Step by step, their lives intertwined, from separate apartments to shared ones, then to a Richmond home and
          the adoption of their beloved dog, Buoy.
